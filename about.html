      <p class="part_1">
        Hello! I'm <span>Ritesh Sarkar</span>, currently a student of class 12 at<span> Daffodil International College.</span> My journey into the world of programming began two years ago and since then, I've been passionately exploring the vast possibilities of technology. My curiosity and drive have led me to master several programming languages and tools.
      </p>

    <p class="part_2">
      I am proficient in <span>HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript</span> which serve as the foundation for my <span> web development</span> projects. I've also ventured into more advanced frameworks like <span>React JS</span> enabling me to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. My programming toolkit extends beyond the web, as I am also skilled in <span>C Programming</span> and have dabbled in <span>Python</span>, which adds versatility to my skill set.

      Learning is a continuous journey for me, and I'm grateful to have been guided by some exceptional mentors and learning platforms. My primary sources of knowledge and inspiration include <span>Hablu Programmer, Procoder BD, Stack Learner</span> and<span>Programming Hero.</span> These platforms have not only provided me with technical expertise but have also inspired me to keep pushing the boundaries of what I can create.

      With every line of code I write, I strive to bring innovative ideas to life, blending creativity with functionality. <span>Chatty-Charm 2.0</span> is a testament to my dedication and passion for programming, and Iâ€™m excited to see where this journey takes me next...
